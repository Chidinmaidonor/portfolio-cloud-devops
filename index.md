# ☁️ Cloud & DevOps Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cloud & DevOps portfolio**.  
This section highlights projects where I applied **cloud engineering, infrastructure automation, and DevOps practices** to build scalable and reliable systems.  

My focus areas include:  
- 🚀 **Cloud Platforms** → AWS, Azure, GCP  
- 🐳 **Containers & Orchestration** → Docker, Kubernetes  
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipelines** → GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI  
- 📊 **Monitoring & Logging** → CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana  
- 🔐 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** → Terraform, Ansible
